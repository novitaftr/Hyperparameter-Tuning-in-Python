# Hyperparameter Tuning in Python for Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, 
indicating the rate at which customers stop using a product or service. 
Understanding the factors contributing to churn is crucial for retaining customers and maintaining revenue. 
In this project, we will analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict customer churn and explore different machine learning classification models, 
including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Dataset Description
The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains customer attributes such as 
contract information, payment method, billing preferences, demographics, 
and churn status. Each row represents a customer, and the target variable, "Churn," indicates whether the customer left within the last month.

## Outlines
### 1. Data Profiling and Cleaning
   - Perform data profiling to understand the dataset's structure, features, and distributions.
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
### 2. Data Transformation
   - Transform categorical variables into numerical representations if necessary.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
### 3. Data Preparation
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.
### 4. Baseline Model
   - Train baseline classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) without hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
### 5. Imbalanced Handling SMOTE
   - Handle imbalanced classes using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
### 6. Decision Tree Visualizations
   - Visualize decision trees for educational purposes to understand model decisions.
### 7. Hyperparameters Tuning
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
   - Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance and generalization.
### 8. Conclusion
   - Summarize findings from the analysis and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Discuss the best-performing model and insights gained from the project.
